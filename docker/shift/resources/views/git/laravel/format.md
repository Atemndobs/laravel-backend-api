Apply Laravel coding style

Shift automatically applies the Laravel coding style - which uses the PSR-2 coding style as a base with some minor additions.

You may customize the code style applied by adding a [PHP CS Fixer][1] or [PHP CodeSniffer][2] ruleset to your project root. Feel free to use [Shift's Laravel ruleset][3] to help you get started.

For more information on customizing the code style applied by Shift, [watch this short video][4].
